    <strong>Important note from Binnes</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Due to some bugs and a design choice, I am choosing to discontinue updating the launcher.</li>
        <li>Bug: Libs use by addons are being duplicated into the main addon directory. This causes an issue if 2 addons are using different versions of the same library.</li>
        <li>Problem: Github limits unauthenticated API requests to 50 per hour, limiting the amount of addons able to be listed. I don't think it's reasonable to ask people to make a github account and log in to the launcher in order to download.</li>
        <li>Check in threads in the addon discussions channel for a directory of all Synastria community addons.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
